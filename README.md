👋 Hi, I’m @luqmanbooso, a passionate student and developer constantly learning and growing in the tech world.
👀 I’m interested in Java web development, operating systems, database management, and networking. I love applying concepts like object-oriented programming, interfaces, and design patterns to build efficient, real-world applications.
🌱 I’m currently learning Java JSP/Servlets, SQL triggers, and the nuances of normalization to design scalable databases. I'm also exploring topics like process/thread management and shared memory in operating systems.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve web applications, process management, or database design. If you’re building something that challenges problem-solving skills, I’m in!
